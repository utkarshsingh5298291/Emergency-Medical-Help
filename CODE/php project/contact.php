    <h3>Online doctor is a term that emerged during the 2000s, used by both the media [1] and academics, to describe a generation of physicians and health practitioners who deliver healthcare, including drug prescription, over the internet.</h3>
    <h3>An online pharmacy, Internet pharmacy, or mail-order pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates over the Internet and sends the orders to customers through the mail or shipping companies.

Online pharmacies might include:

Pharmacy benefit manager â€“ A large administrator of corporate prescription drug plans
Legitimate Internet pharmacy in the same country as the person ordering.
Legitimate Internet pharmacy in a different country than the person ordering. This pharmacy usually is licensed by its home country and follows those regulations, not those of the international orders.
Illegal or unethical internet pharmacy. The web page for an illegal pharmacy may contain lies about its home country, procedures, or certifications. The "pharmacy" may send outdated (expired shelf life) or counterfeit medications and may not follow normal procedural safeguards.
</h3>
